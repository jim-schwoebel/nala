Nala is an agile open-source voice assistant to improve the workflow of your daily life.

Nala uses actions which can be triggered by user voice queries. All the user needs to do is say 'hey nala' and it will spark Nala to listen and respond to requests - like getting the weather or the news.

And yes, her name is inspired after Nala from the Lion King :-) 

## getting started

It's super easy to setup Nala. All you need to do is:

    git clone 
    cd nala
    python3 setup.py
    python3 nala.py
    
You will then be asked to register with your name, email, and a few other [registration tasks](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/nala/wiki/3.-Registration).

After that, you're ready to begin using Nala! 

## how to query Nala

### Single queries 

To active Nala, all you need to do is query her with 'Hey Nala!' (1) - which then triggers a response from Nala - (3) in this case, “How can I help you?.” Then, a user provides another query (usually after some beeping sound) - such as (4) “I’d like the weather.” Nala transcribes this query to understand it, and parses the query for keyword intents; for example, if the response is “I’d like the weather” the only word that really matters is “weather” and that would be used to provoke a response (5). Then, after this keyword maps onto an action dictionary (or a map of responses to keywords), the action is executed (6). Then, the intent loop repeats itself, looking for another wakeword (“Hey Nala”) before triggering another action. 

### Multi-query capability 

Nala is equipped with multi-query capability. All you need to do is add 'AND' into your query and she'll automatically execute actions serially that you request to her. 

For example, you may say, "Hey Nala" --> "close spotify and sleep" 

She will then close spotify and then go to sleep for 30 minutes. 

This makes Nala incredibly versatile to do multiple things quickly and is an advantage over other chatbot systems. 

## what can Nala do
